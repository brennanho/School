parameter is a pointer to a routine that takes as its first argument an item pointer,
and as its second argument comparisonArg. Comparator returns 0 if the item and
comparisonArg don't match, or 1 if they do. Exactly what constitutes a match is
up to the implementor of comparator. If a match is found, the current pointer is
left at the matched item and the pointer to that item is returned. If no match is
found, the current pointer is left beyond the end of the list and a NULL pointer is
returned*/
